Thank you for your interest in contributing!

All contributions are welcome, might it be a simple fix of a typo or the rewrite of an entire module.<br>
Before working on the change, check if there is already somebody working on the problem (Search issues or look through the commits/code).<br>
Please try to match the coding style as closely as possible by looking at the existing code.<br>
If you are not sure about something, simply [create a new issue](https://github.com/proxer/ProxerAndroid/issues/new). The PR does not need to be perfect at first as it can be reviewed and improved!<br>
All contributors will be credited in the README.
